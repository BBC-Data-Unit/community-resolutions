In June 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47697778) violent offenders were being handed informal punishments by the police, despite guidance restricting their use to low-level offences.

Offences including burglary, sexual assault, violence and arson have led police to issue community resolutions, which do not involve going to court.

Critics said the orders were being used "contrary to their original purpose".

The National Police Chiefs' Council said community resolutions should not be used in the most serious cases.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed crime outcomes data published by the Home Office from 2014 to 2018.

It found:

- About 112,000 offenders had been dealt with through community resolution orders each year since 2014
- The orders represented about 3% of all crime outcomes, but there had been a slight decline in their use over that period

From 2014 to 2018, they were issued for:

- Some 2,500 sex offences including 27 rapes (police forces said these disposals could relate to sexual activity between children including sexting)
- Some 5,000 for possession of weapons, including knives and guns
- Some 156,000 for violent offences against the person including 1,720 for cruelty to children
- Some 151,000 for theft offences including 3,555 for burglaries and 309 for aggravated vehicle taking
